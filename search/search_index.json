You are more likely to succeed if you have some of the following skills or are interested in developing them.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Programming in some major language (C++, R, Python, etc): While we aren't sticklers for language (we want to use the right tool for a given job), we generally try to avoid working with proprietary software, such as MATLAB and GAMS. It helps when the group focuses on a couple of programming languages to facilitate collaboration. We tend to focus on R, Python, and Julia, though there are times when C or C++ is required. However, if you know some other languages, you should be able to pick these up with some effort and code examples, so don't worry too much if you haven't used these specific languages before.</p> </li> <li> <p>Statistics, applied mathematics, and optimization: Our work is fundamentally impacted by uncertainty. This means that we need to know how to develop or modify models to allow for uncertainty-characterization workflows, quantify uncertainty when we can, and perform sensitivity analyses. If you have a solid background in probability or statistics, it will help you hit the ground running. A lot of our work also involves decision-making, which means that it is helpful to have some exposure to or interest in optimization.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In general, if you can program, have a solid math background, and some exposure to statistics, you are well-equipped to succeed in our group.

A Ph.D. is a license to do independent research, which means you should be able to ask and answer questions such as \"Why am I doing this research?\" and to follow the scientific method, which involves formulating and testing hypotheses, not just turning the crank or dredging through data or model output. You should be able to tell a story about why you posed a particular question, how your prior understanding of the area led you to formulate certain hypotheses, how you designed your experiment to test those hypotheses, and what the implications of the results are for your hypotheses in particular and the field in general.</p> <p>Critical thinking is an important part of not just research, but life. We want to be cognizant of why we are doing science, both so we do it well and so we know it makes us happy. Part of your training will involve developing these skills! What is expected when you apply will depend on your background and what credential you are pursuing. If you want a Ph.D. and have an M.S., Vivek will expect that your critical thinking skills are relatively well-developed. If you're coming straight from undergrad, the expectations will not be as high, as you haven't had graduate training yet.

It's worth the time to reach out and get feedback on whether you should apply to work with a given supervisor. If you and Vivek have mutual interest in you joining the group ahead of time, it increases the chances of a successful admission more than a blind application. If you are interested in applying, but would like feedback on whether you would be a good fit with our group, take the following advice into consideration when writing your initial email expressing interest.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Read the group website and this lab manual thoroughly before you send an email: You should have an awareness of what kind of work we do, what will be expected of you, and what you can expect from us. You can certainly ask questions to clarify these issues if something isn't expressed clearly enough, but it will become apparent if you haven't done this due diligence. You should also not ask questions that are included in the FAQ below, as this is a sign that you haven't looked closely at the manual, particularly this page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Attach relevant documents: To get the most informed feedback, you should include your current CV or resume (as a <code>.pdf</code>), a draft of your personal statement or a statement of your research interests (ideally as a <code>pdf</code>), and any relevant prior work you'd like Vivek to see. This helps him get a sense of your interests and incoming skillset.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain why you are reaching out to Vivek specifically: Did you read one of our group's papers (and if so, which one(s))? Was a project or opening listed on the website of particular interest? It's helpful for Vivek to know why our group appeared on your radar. For this reason, mass e-mails are unlikely to receive productive responses. An inquiry that references a specific paper or material and ties it to your interests and what you hope to gain as a member of our group is the most likely to get a positive response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ask specific questions: It's hard to provide feedback if your expression of interest is vague, and this can be a sign that you haven't fully thought through whether we would be a good fit for you. For example, you might ask questions like:</p> <ul> <li>\"Are you still working on <code>&lt;some topic&gt;</code>&gt;?\" or \"Are you interested in <code>&lt;some topic</code>&gt;?\"</li> <li>\"Do you have funding for students in the fall?\" (This will hopefully be made clear on the website, but it's ok to ask to be sure).</li> <li>\"Is <code>&lt;this method&gt;</code> something you use?\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If your only questions are \"Should I apply?\" or \"Can you look at my application?\", the only answers that I can give you are \"It's up to you\" and \"If your application is in the pool, I will see it.\"</p>"},{"location":"applying/graduate/#video-chats","title":"Video Chats","text":"<p>You will be asked to participate in a video chat with Vivek. This is intended to evaluate your verbal communications skills and whether you can further articulate your interests, and is not intended to be a formal interview. Ideally, it would help ensure that you and Vivek get along well enough to provide a productive mentoring relationship, but this is impossible to ensure until you've spent time with the group. If, based on your interests, you'll likely be working closely with another graduate student or a postdoc, Vivek may request that you have a followup one-on-one with the relevant individual(s) to discuss interests and background.</p> <p>No judgement whatsoever will be made based on video background, and don't feel the need to dress up for these chats.

References do not count toward the page limit. It doesn't matter which of these you use, but be consistent.</li> <li>You may use large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you write your evaluation. However, you should be prepared to answer detailed questions about what you have written and to explain your reasoning, which will be hard if you haven't read the paper carefully.

It is, of course, understood that this plan is likely to be dynamic and may change as you engage in research, are exposed to other areas or ideas in seminars or by talking to collaborators, or take additional courses. The important thing is that you are working on problems which you find fulfilling and intellectually stimulating.</li> <li>Stay in good standing: Graduate programs have a wide variety of requirements, from required courses and credits to exam dates. While Vivek will help you manage these requirements, it is important that you stay on top of them and your status and communicate with him about any upcoming deadlines or needs.</li> <li>Focus on your research: If you're in a thesis-based program (an M.S. or a Ph.D.), your research is the most important part of your graduate education. For students in professional programs (M.Eng. and M.P.S.), your project is a key part of your overall experience. You should prioritize your research as such and treat it professionally.</li> <li>Succeed in your coursework: Depending on your program, there are periods (or your entire program) in grad school that are dominated by coursework. You should try to get as much from your coursework as possible (while meeting your other responsibilities) and connect it to your research whenever possible.</li> <li>Develop independence: You should not hesitate to pursue and discuss your own ideas as they arise. Within the context of your time management system (and without compromising your personal time), set aside time to read new papers in and out of your field, attend as many seminars as you can, and run independent experiments with new models and datasets. Make sure you discuss ideas and results with Vivek and the broader group for feedback.</li> <li>Develop a career plan: There is no hiding the fact that there is a clear opportunity cost to attending graduate school. You should think carefully about what type of job you would like to have, and what credential and what type of training would best prepare you for your ambitions. This plan is likely to be dynamic, and communication with Vivek and others in the group is important.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"expectations/roles/#undergraduate-students","title":"Undergraduate Students","text":"<p>Undergrads who are working with the research group have several responsibilities.</p> <ol> <li>Learn!: As an undergrad, you are not necessarily expected to write and publish papers or give presentations (though it's great for your resume if you can!).

Many people will skim your work and only takeaway anything from the figures, or will only read your work if the figures seem interesting. Figure design is just as, if not more, essential when communicating results to stakeholders and the media. As a result, it is important to make your figures memorable. As a rule of thumb, you should have one figure for each key result.</p> <p>Unfortunately, making memorable figures which also communicate key points effectively is not easy. As Munzer (2014)1 says,</p> <p>The most fundamental reason that vis design is a difficult enterprise is that the vast majority of the possibilities in the design space will be ineffective for any specific usage context. In some cases, a possible design is a poor match with the properties of the human perceptual and cognitive systems. In other cases, the design would be comprehensible by a human in some other setting, but it\u2019s a bad match with the intended task. Only a very small number of possibilities are in the set of reasonable choices, and of those only an even smaller fraction are excellent choices. Randomly choosing possibilities is a bad idea because the odds of finding a very good solution are very low.</p> <p>Tufte (1983)2 characterizes graphical excellence as</p> <p>[It] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency...[It] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space...[It] requires telling the truth about the data.</p> <p>Many graphics packages use default settings which may not be the result of ideal choices. Visualizing uncertainty is also challenging. This page presents some general guidelines on figure design, but these are not to be treated as dogma, as each case is unique, and breaking some of these rules may create more effective figures in certain cases. Ultimately, data visualization is contextual, and the only way to create effective figures is to understand the structure of your data to have insight into how to honestly guide viewers to relevant take-aways.</p>"},{"location":"guides/figures/#general-guidelines","title":"General Guidelines","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Be aware of what can go wrong: Munzer (2014)1 provides the following overview of what can make a visualization invalid or ineffective:</p> <ol> <li>Wrong domain: you misunderstood the needs of the viewer;3</li> <li>Wrong abstraction: you show viewers the wrong information;</li> <li>Wrong idiom or channel: the way you show the information doesn't work.</li> <li>Wrong algorithm: the code to generate the figure is too slow.4</li> </ol> <p>Healy (2019)5 describes the following elements of bad figures: 1. Bad taste: figures which are too obsessed with looking flashy or are hard to read; 2. Bad data: figures based on data which are cherry picked or which represent the wrong measure for the question; 3. Bad perception: figures which inaccurately or misleadingly encode the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use preattentive cues and features whenever possible without misleading: Human image processing and memory works in three stages. First, preattentive processing occurs in iconic memory. This is a fast recognition process, can work on many chunks at once, and requires little cognitive effort. Second, a few meaningful visual chunks are passed to short-term (or working) memory for attentive processing. Attentive processing can include searching or making conscious comparisons. However, information is retained here for a short amount of time. Finally, information which is repeatedly processed in working memory can be moved to long-term memory, from where they can be retrieved for additional or repeated attentive processing.</p> <p>Effective use of features which can be processed preattentively can result in more complex patterns being extracted for attentive processing and less cognitive fatigue on the part of viewers. Preattentive features include differences in shape, size, color, movement, and positioning. Think about how to use these to make patterns \"pop out\" from a quick scan of the figure.</p> <p>However, be aware that preattentive features can work against you if used carelessly or misleadingly (this is how many optical illustions work). Show your figures to several other people (and/or in the lab meetings) to get their feedback on how much cognitive effort is required to process the figure and to identify if you're communicating the right take-aways.</p> </li> <li> <p>The effectiveness of different channels can vary: Channels are the ways in which information is encoded within a visualization, such as position, color, and shape. Summarizing several studies, Munzer (2014)1 ranks channels for ordered attributes by their effectiveness as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Position on a common scale</li> <li>Position on an unaligned scale</li> <li>Length (1D size)</li> <li>Tilt/angle</li> <li>Area (2D size)</li> <li>Depth (3D position)</li> <li>Color luminance (brightness/darkness)</li> <li>Color saturation (intensity)</li> <li>Curvature</li> <li>Volume (2D size)</li> </ol> <p>Munzer (2014)1 also ranks channels for categorical attributes:</p> <ol> <li>Spatial region</li> <li>Color hue</li> <li>Motion</li> <li>Shape</li> </ol> <p>The effectiveness of channels can be reduced through interference, where interactions between multiple channels make it difficult to preattentively identify patterns. For example, differences in color saturation are more difficult to identify in small points or thin lines than in larger points or thicker lines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use points and lines thoughtfully: A common default is for lines to be used for all visual elements in some types of visualizations, such as time series plots. However, lines invite the viewer to interpolate between points. This is not necessarily appropriate for data points given observational uncertainties and nonlinearities, which mean they should be treated as discrete elements. Use points when individual elements should be treated discretely (or categorically) and lines or curves when you would like to suggest inter- or extrapolation, such as with continuous model output.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If multiple lines are used in a figure, try to rely on their color and position to encode information, rather than the size of areas between them, as area is a far less effective channel. Also, try to avoid relying on line width, both because of the problems with perceiving differences in area, and because small differences in line width are difficult to perceive, while width can only be increased so much before a line appears to be a polygon.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use 3D judiciously: There are situations where 3D visualizations can be effective, such as when the key takeaway is the broad 3D structure of the data. Often it is more effective to use two spatial dimensions combined with other channels (but not too many!), or multiple projections of the underlying 3D space onto 2D planes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use multiple panels when comparisons across multiple visualizations are desired: Using the eyes to switch between panels which are simultaneously visible (preattentively) is less cognitively demanding than requiring the viewer to remember previous plots (attentively).</p> </li> <li> <p>Align panels along common axes: Position along a common scale is the most effective channel. When multiple panels are required and they have common axes, alignment along one of these axes allows the eye to compare features more easily.</p> </li> <li> <p>Avoid chartjunk -- when it is chartjunk: Chartjunk refers to extraneous elements of a plot that aren't essential for communicating the relevant information. Tufte (1983)2 argues strongly and convincingly against chartjunk. It complicates preattentive processing and increases cognitive load. However, what is chartjunk is contextual. In some cases, a background grid is chartjunk, but in others (such as multiple panels), the use of a grid or lines may help to align the eye and ease comparisons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use color-blind palettes: For example, avoid combining red and green in a colormap, as many individuals are red-green colorblind and will not be able to identify the intended differences. Some examples of color-blind palettes can be found at ColorBrewer and Paul Tol's website.</p> </li> <li> <p>Experiment with different representations of uncertainty: Uncertainty is difficult to communicate visually. Many different representations exist, including:</p> <ul> <li>ranges (e.g. intervals or boxplots)</li> <li>distributions (e.g. histograms or probability distribution functions)</li> <li>cumulative distribution functions</li> <li>traces of individual realizations.</li> </ul> <p>Not all of these visualization types are relevant for all analyses. Each has its pros and cons. For example, ranges are relatively simple to interpret, but the type and extent of the range must be specified explicitly (e.g. 90% credible interval, or the range encoded by the box in a boxplot, as this can be non-standard). Distributions may be less intuitive  but include additional information about where probability mass is located. Cumulative distribution functions are useful for comparing or locating quantiles. Try out different plot types and see what works the best for the message you're trying to communicate, and possibly combine different types. Also, try to analyze figures that you find effective.</p> </li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Munzner, T. (2014). Visualization Analysis &amp; Design.

Link this from the meta-repository README.</li> <li>Generated data should be archived. <ul> <li>If you generated a unique dataset for your project, the code for this should be included as part of the meta-repository for the paper.</li> <li>If you're generating data which will be reused for other projects, it's worth making a repository just for the generation code and linking to a released version of that repository in the meta-repository.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Avoid hard-coding absolute paths. If you use an external model or data, let the user set a path to point to where they've installed those resources, then use paths relative to them in the rest of the code.</li> <li>Make separate folders for different parts of the analysis to improve readability (e.g. separate data pre-processing, experiment, and figure-generation codes). </li> <li>Make individual scripts for each figure you are generating. If all of your figures require large files to generate (for example, the results of a large-scale simulation), make another script which loads the data and then calls the figure-generating scripts in turn.
