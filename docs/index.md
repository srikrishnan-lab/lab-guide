## Mission

Our mission is to support the resilience of societal units (from global to individual) to dynamic environmental risks by informing impact-management strategies. These strategies are understood in the broad sense, and can include mitigating new risks or adapting to existing or anticipated ones. Through mission-oriented basic research, we develop tools and methods to transparently and collaboratively inform decision-making to help improve equity and be responsive to diverse sets of stakeholder preferences and values.
