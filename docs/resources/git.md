# git and GitHub

[git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} is a software version control system. git is useful for tracking changes to code, including systematic approaches to adding new features or changing functionality. We use git to track and save code as we're working on it.

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is one of several online repositories for sharing code (and is commonly used as a remote repository for git). We use GitHub to facilitate collaboration and share code for papers and other projects.

## Usage

When you start a new project, you should [create a GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo){:target="_blank"} right away. It may be prudent to set up initial repositories as `private` until you're ready to release the code (which should always be done ahead of paper submission).

## Alternatives

There are several alternatives to GitHub, including [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/){:target="_blank"}. You may use whichever online repository you prefer, though we use GitHub for lab-wide management, such as the website and lab manual.
