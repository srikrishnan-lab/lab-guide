# Julia

[Julia](https://julialang.org/){:target="_blank"} is a high-performance language for scientific computing, which also happens to be readable. Julia may be the best choice for our work, though there may be times when your collaborators want to use Python or R, or when tools already exist in those languages that are perfect for a particular project.

## Installation

Use the current stable release of Julia.

## Usage

If you're coming from MATLAB or Python, [here](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/){:target="_blank"} is a useful cheatsheet for translating common operations into Julia.

## Development Environments

[Juno](https://junolab.org/){:target="_blank"} is a Julia IDE built off the [Atom](https://atom.io){:target="_blank"} text editor.

## Recommended Packages

* [`Turing`](https://turing.ml/stable/){:target="_blank"}: probabilistic programs for statistical inference.
* [`Flux`](https://fluxml.ai/){:target="_blank"}: machine learning libraries

[David Anthoff](https://www.david-anthoff.com/){:target="_blank"} at UC Berkeley has been developing the [Mimi Framework](https://www.mimiframework.org/){:target="_blank"} for integrated assessment modeling. Many IAMs have been ported into this framework, and can be coupled with earth-system models.
