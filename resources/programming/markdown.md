# Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} is a powerful but lightweight formatting system for Web (and other) publishing. Among other features, it allows for clean embedding of code blocks and blockquotes within a document, as well as the creation of bibliographies from a variety of sources.

Markdown has some limitations, but emphasizes the readability of markups. It is used to create documentation for [GitHub repositories](/lab-manual/coding/git.md){:target="_blank"}. We do not use Markdown to typeset papers, but it is convenient for other types of documents.

Many text editors include Markdown functionality, and many include previews for Markdown documents. Markdown can also be used to [embed R code in a document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}, either to produce plots and analyses at document publication or to just include relevant code in a document.
