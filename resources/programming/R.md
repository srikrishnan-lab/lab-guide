# R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/){:target="_blank"} is a statistical programming language, and is highly optimized for that purpose (though additional functionality exists). It can be relatively slow and doesn't use memory particularly effectively, but it has a wide variety of data analysis and statistical modeling functions and libraries. R syntax is a bit different than other languages, but you may collaborate with people who prefer to work in R, so it's good to know your way around it.

## Installation

Use the latest version of R that you can, but it's not essential (usually) to stay on top of updates. R can be managed using conda, but conda only maintains some packages. It's still generally good practice to create new environments for different projects.

## Usage

Hadley Wickham has several good (and freely available online!) R books, depending on your level of familiarity:

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank"}
* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/){:target="_blank"}

Kieran Healy has [an excellent book on data visualization](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html){:target="_blank"} using the `ggplot2` library.

## Development Environments

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"} is the best graphical R IDE around. Otherwise, you can work in a text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io){:target="_blank"} equipped with an R linter and (maybe) a code-completion package.
